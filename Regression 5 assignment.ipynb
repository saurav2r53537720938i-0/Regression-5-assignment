    "Elastic Net Regression is a regularization technique that combines the penalties of both lasso(l1)and ridge(l2) regression methods.it is used to overcome the limitations of both techniques by balancing between them.In tradtional regression technique like Ordinary Least Square the model aims to minimize the sum of squared residual however it may lead to overfitting when dealing with high-dimensional data multicolinearity.Elastic net regression on the other hands adds both L1andL2 penalties to handle multicollinearity and perform feature slection simultaneously."
